# Polar Themes README

These color schemes are a fork of Arctic Ice Studio's Nord theme to update the markdown syntax highlighting for Sublime Text. The adaptive color theme is principally based on the default adaptive them, but with some tweaks. The color schemes include Nord's original gray background and a new dark background.

The themes include icons principally based on the FileIcons package.
